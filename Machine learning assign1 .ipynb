    "The algorithm tries to find the underlying structure or distribution of the data. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\n",

    "Semi-supervised learning: Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that combines both labeled and unlabeled data. \n",
    "The algorithm learns from the labeled data and tries to generalize to the unlabeled data. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to improve the accuracy of the model by using the unlabeled data.\n",
